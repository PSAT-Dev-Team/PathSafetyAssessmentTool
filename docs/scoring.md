## 6.1 Overview

CycleRAP produces four independent risk scores for each road segment, each representing a distinct crash scenario:

| Score | Crash type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **BB** | Bicyclist–Bicyclist | Conflict between cyclists (and with light vehicles) |
| **BP** | Bicyclist–Pedestrian | Conflict between a cyclist and a pedestrian |
| **SB** | Single Bicyclist | Cyclist departing facility and striking a fixed/severe hazard |
| **VB** | Vehicle–Bicyclist | Conflict between a motor vehicle and a cyclist |

Each score is a continuous real number. Scores are then classified into one of four **risk bands**.

An **Overall Risk Level** (the sum of all four scores) and an **Overall Risk Level Band** (the maximum of the four component bands) are also computed.

---

## 6.2 Risk Bands

### 6.21 BB, BP, SB

| Band | Label | Score range |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Low | < 5 |
| 2 | Medium | 5 – 10 |
| 3 | High | 10 – 20 |
| 4 | Extreme | > 20 |

### 6.22 VB

| Band | Label | Score range |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Low | < 10 |
| 2 | Medium | 10 – 25 |
| 3 | High | 25 – 60 |
| 4 | Extreme | > 60 |

### 6.23 Overall Risk Level Band

Equal to the **maximum** band across BB, BP, SB, and VB for that segment. This means a single extreme sub-score elevates the overall band to Extreme regardless of the others.

---

## 6.3 Algorithm: Component Formulas

The algorithm builds four intermediate components (`CM3`, `CM16`, `CM25`, `CM40`) and then combines them into the final scores.

### 6.31 CM3 — Main Cycling Environment Risk

```
CM3 = (product of CU factors) ^ (1 + CQ_sum × 0.1)
```

**CU factors** (continuous risk multipliers):

| Factor | Attribute | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Loose/slippery surface | `Loose or slippery surface` | 1.5 if Present |
| Delineation | `Delineation` | 1.2 if Not Present |
| Facility width | `Facility Width per Direction` | 1.8/1.5/1.0 for Very Narrow/Narrow/Wide |
| Flow direction | `Flow Direction` | 1.5 if Two Way |
| Width restriction | `Width Restriction` | 1.2 if Present |
| Grade | `Grade` | 1.2 if ≥5 Degrees |
| Cargo bikes | `Observed proportion of cargo bikes` | 1.2 if Moderate to high |
| Pedestrian flow | `Peak pedestrian flow` | 1.2 if Low; 1.5 if Moderate to high |
| Bicycle flow | `Peak bicycle/LV traffic flow` | 1.2 if Moderate to high |
| Speed differential | `Bicycle/LV speed differential` | 1.2 if ≥10 km/h |
| Curvature | `Curvature` | 1.5 if Sharp Turn Present |
| Street lighting | `Street Lighting` | 1.2 if Not Present |

**CQ triggers** (condition flags that increase the exponent):

| Trigger | Attribute | Fires when |
|---|---|---|
| Surface deformation | `Major Surface Deformation or Drain Opening` | Present |
| Fixed obstacle | `Fixed Obstacle on Facility` | Present |
| Non-fixed obstacle | `Non-Fixed Obstacle on Facility` | Present |
| Adjacent parking 0–1m | `Adjacent Vehicle Parking 0-1m` | Present |
| Intersection crossing | `Intersection or Road Crossing` | Present |
| Property access | `Property Access` | Present |
| Intersecting facility | `Intersecting Bicycle Facility` | Present |
| Pedestrian crossing | `Pedestrian Crossing` | Present |

### 6.32 CM16 — Departure and Fall Scenarios

Only fires if at least one of: Loose/slippery surface, Grade ≥5°, or Curvature = Sharp Turn.

### 6.33 CM25 — Speed-Related Incidents

Only fires if at least one of: Tram/train rails present, Surface deformation present.

### 6.34 CM40 — Vehicle Interaction

Only fires if at least one of: Intersection crossing, Property access, Adjacent road 0–1m, Adjacent road 1–3m, Facility type = Mixed Traffic, Intersection approach = Shared.

### 6.35 Final Score Combination

The four components combine into final scores as follows:

```
cj3  = CM3 + CM16   # combined conflict exposure
cj25 = CM25         # fall hazard modifier
cj40 = CM40         # shared space conflict modifier

BB = cj3 × (bicycle_speed × grade × speed_differential × cargo_bike factors)

BP = BB_component × sidewalk_condition
   + BB_component × pedestrian_condition
   (each term is 0 if the condition is absent)

SB = cj3 × severity_factors                  [departure gate — 0 if no departure condition]
   + (cj3 + cj25) × fall_severity_factors    [fall gate — 0 if no fall condition]

VB = (cj3 + cj25) × factors   [fall/conflict — 0 if condition absent]
   + cj3 × factors             [departure — 0 if condition absent]
   + cj40 ÷ 3                  [intersection term 1 — 0 if condition absent]
   + cj40 ÷ 3                  [intersection term 2 — 0 if condition absent]
   + cj40 ÷ 3                  [intersection term 3 — 0 if condition absent]
```

**Key takeaway:** BB and BP are driven entirely by CM3 + CM16. SB additionally incorporates CM25 for fall scenarios. VB is the only score that uses CM40 (shared-space and intersection conflicts).

---

## 6.4 Worked Example: CM3

The following example traces a single segment through the CM3 calculation by hand.

**Segment attributes:**

| Attribute | Value | Code |
|---|---|---|
| Loose or slippery surface | Not Present | 2 |
| Delineation | Not Present | 2 |
| Facility Width per Direction | Narrow | 2 |
| Flow Direction | One Way | 1 |
| Width Restriction | Not Present | 2 |
| Grade | < 5 Degrees | 1 |
| Observed proportion of cargo bikes | Low | 1 |
| Peak pedestrian flow | None | 1 |
| Peak bicycle/LV traffic flow | Low | 1 |
| Bicycle/LV speed differential | < 10 km/h | 1 |
| Curvature | Sharp Turn Present | 1 |
| Street Lighting | Present | 1 |
| All CQ-trigger fields | Not Present / N/A | 2 |

**Step 1 — Build the CU product:**

```
CU = 1.0  (loose surface: Not Present → 1.0)
   × 1.2  (delineation:  Not Present → 1.2)
   × 1.5  (width:        Narrow      → 1.5)
   × 1.0  (flow:         One Way     → 1.0)
   × 1.0  (width restr:  Not Present → 1.0)
   × 1.0  (grade:        <5°         → 1.0)
   × 1.0  (cargo bikes:  Low         → 1.0)
   × 1.0  (ped flow:     None        → 1.0)
   × 1.0  (bike flow:    Low         → 1.0)
   × 1.0  (speed diff:   <10 km/h    → 1.0)
   × 1.5  (curvature:    Sharp Turn  → 1.5)
   × 1.0  (lighting:     Present     → 1.0)
   = 1.8
```

**Step 2 — Count the CQ triggers:**

All eight CQ-trigger fields (surface deformation, fixed obstacle, non-fixed obstacle, adjacent parking 0–1m, intersection crossing, property access, intersecting facility, pedestrian crossing) are coded as Not Present. CQ_sum = 0.

**Step 3 — Apply the formula:**

```
CM3 = CU_product ^ (1 + CQ_sum × 0.1)
    = 1.8 ^ (1 + 0 × 0.1)
    = 1.8 ^ 1.0
    = 1.8
```

**Now add one CQ trigger — set Intersection or Road Crossing = Present (1):**

- CQ_sum = 1 (intersection_crossing fires)

```
CM3 = 1.8 ^ (1 + 1 × 0.1)
    = 1.8 ^ 1.1
    ≈ 1.91
```

The exponent increases by 0.1 per active CQ trigger, compounding the base risk. Eight simultaneous triggers would raise the exponent to 1.8, producing `1.8^1.8 ≈ 2.66`.



Road traffic volume is converted to a risk factor using a stepped lookup table:

| AADT threshold | Risk factor |
|---|---|
| < 100 | 0.25 |
| 100 – 499 | 0.25 |
| 500 – 1499 | 0.50 |
| 1500 – 2499 | 0.75 |
| 2500 – 4999 | 1.00 |
| 5000 – 7499 | 1.07 |
| 7500 – 9999 | 1.14 |
| 10000 – 12499 | 1.23 |
| 12500 – 14999 | 1.31 |
| 15000 – 17499 | 1.40 |
| 17500 – 19999 | 1.50 |
| 20000 – 22499 | 1.61 |
| 22500 – 24999 | 1.72 |
| 25000 – 29999 | 1.84 |
| 30000 – 34999 | 1.97 |
| 35000 – 39999 | 2.10 |
| ≥ 40000 | 2.25 |

### 6.41 Road Speed Risk Factor

Operating speed is converted via a sigmoid formula:

```
lookup_speed = round(speed) - 1
risk = 1 + 27.82 / (1 + exp(5.84 − 0.091 × lookup_speed))
```

> Speed is first rounded to the nearest integer, then decremented by 1 before the sigmoid is applied. Returns 1.0 if speed ≤ 1.

## 6.5 Attribute Fields Reference

The table below documents every field stored per segment. **39 fields are actively used in the scoring algorithm**; the remaining fields (Area type, Road speed limit, operating speed, unit) are stored for reference or display but do not feed into the CycleRAP formulas.

> The data model contains 43 fields in total. Of those: 39 are scored, 1 (Area type) is metadata only, and 3 (Road speed limit, operating speed, unit) are informational. The "41 fields" figure cited in CycleRAP v2.11 literature refers to the 41 coded attributes including Area type but excluding the three road speed fields.

> Fields are grouped below to match the attribute panel groupings in the PSAT UI.

## 6.7 Treatment Logic

The 25 predefined treatments (defined in `routes.py`) each have:
- **Triggers:** one or more sets of `{field: [allowed_values]}` conditions. If any trigger set matches, the treatment is applicable.
- **Effects:** `{field: new_value}` pairs applied to the segment's attributes before re-scoring.

Treatments are evaluated by `apply_treatments`, `apply_all_treatments`, and `preview_treatments` endpoints. The projected score change (before/after) is returned so the user can see the improvement.

### 6.71 Treatment List

| ID | Name | Key trigger condition |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Upgrade to on-road bicycle lane with light segregation | Road shoulder or mixed traffic, no light segregation |
| 2 | Safety barrier (adjacent road 0–1m) | Bicycle lane/shoulder with adjacent road < 1m and intersection |

## 6.8 Updating the CycleRAP Algorithm

When CycleRAP releases an updated risk scoring model (e.g., transitioning from v2.11 to a newer version), the development team must update the scoring module. 

Administrators are advised to contact developers when a new model is released. The update process generally involves the following steps:

1. **Reviewing the New Specifications**: Obtain the new CycleRAP methodology documentation or Excel reference tool.
2. **Updating `LOOKUP_TABLES`**: Modify the attribute-to-risk-factor dictionaries in `backend/app/services/cyclerap_scoring.py` to match the new multipliers.
3. **Adjusting Formula Equations**: If new formulas are introduced for intermediate components (e.g., `CM3`, `CM16`, `CM25`, `CM40`) or final scores (`BB`, `BP`, `SB`, `VB`), update the corresponding `calculate_cmX()` and `calculate_cyclerap_score()` functions.
4. **Modifying Attribute Definitions**: If the new model introduces new fields or changes the allowed values (enums) for existing fields, update the data model, including frontend forms and backend shapefile ingestion validation.
5. **Testing**: Validate the updated Python output against the new official CycleRAP reference tool (typically using a test batch of road segments) to ensure full fidelity.
