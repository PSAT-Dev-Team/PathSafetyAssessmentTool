### 5.1 Select Projects

You can select one or more projects to analyse together. The search box matches both **project names** and **source road names**, so you can find projects even when the project title and road name differ.

### 5.2 Filter Before Loading

Before loading projects, you can filter by:

| Filter | Description |
|---|---|
| Project or road name | Text search |
| Tag | e.g. NSC, AMK, Pre, Post |
| Date created range | Filter projects created within a date window |
| Last updated range | Filter projects updated within a date window |

### 5.3 Analyse Loaded Data

After loading projects, you can:

- choose **up to five attributes** to focus on
- apply segment-level filters (see sections below)
- view attribute distributions and aggregated score-band summaries
- inspect filtered segments on the map and in the table
- click a segment to navigate to the Coding page to make edits
- click **Back to Analysis** to return and continue

#### 5.3.1 Attribute Filters and Finer Filtering

When you select an attribute for analysis, you can filter segments by its coded values. Attributes marked **❖** also support **finer filtering** — selecting a specific value (e.g. *Present* for Fixed Obstacle on Facility) reveals a secondary sub-category dropdown so you can pinpoint exact sub-types. The map updates to show distinct colours for each sub-category once a sub-type is selected.

| Attribute | Filter Values | Finer Filter Sub-categories (❖ = available) |
|---|---|---|
| Facility Type | Sidewalk; Multi-Use Path; Off-Road Bicycle Path; On-road Bicycle Lane; Road Shoulder; Mixed Traffic Road Lane | — |
| Area Type | Urban/CBD; Suburban; Rural; Industrial; Recreational | — |
| Adjacent Road Lane 0–1m | Present; Not Present | — |
| Adjacent Road Lane 1–3m | Present; Not Present | — |
| Adjacent Vehicle Parking 0–1m | Present; Not Present | — |
| Adjacent Vehicle Parking 1–3m | Present; Not Present | — |
| Facility Width per Direction **❖** | Very Narrow; Narrow; Wide | Very Narrow: ≤1.5m; >1.5–1.8m; >1.8–<2m · Narrow: 2–<3.5m; 3.5–4m · Wide: >4m |

| Overall Risk Level Band | 1 (Low); 2 (Medium); 3 (High); 4 (Extreme) | — |

#### 5.3.2 Finer Filtering — Sub-category Options

Selecting a top-level filter value for any attribute marked **❖** reveals a secondary sub-category dropdown. Each sub-category is shown with a distinct colour on the map.

| Attribute | Trigger Value | Sub-category Options |
|---|---|---|
| Facility Width per Direction | Very Narrow | ≤1.5 m; >1.5–1.8 m; >1.8–<2 m |
| Facility Width per Direction | Narrow | 2–<3.5 m; 3.5–4 m |
| Facility Width per Direction | Wide | >4 m |
| Curvature | Sharp Turn Present | <6.5 m (footpath threshold); 6.5–<10 m; Path Junction |
| Curvature | No Sharp Turn Present | 10–18 m; >18 m (cycling path threshold ≥18 m) |
| Fixed Obstacle on Facility | Present | Lamp Post; Traffic Light; Pillar; Bollards; Fence; Vegetation; Others |
| Non-Fixed Obstacle on Facility | Present | Barrier; Bins; Bicycle; Cone; Others |
| Delineation | Present | Cycling Path; Red Stripe; Signalised Crossing; Traffic Crossing; Zebra Crossing |
| Crossing Facility | Present | Zebra Crossing; Signalised PC; Bicycle Crossing; Unsignalised Junction; Development Access |

**How to use finer filtering:**

1. In the Filter panel, select an attribute that supports finer filtering (marked **❖**).
2. Choose a top-level value (e.g. *Present* for Fixed Obstacle on Facility).
3. A second dropdown appears — select the specific sub-type you want to highlight.
4. The map immediately updates to colour only segments matching that sub-type.
5. To adjust or clear the sub-filter, click the **×** on the active sub-category chip, or change the top-level value.

> **If the finer filtering colours are not appearing correctly on the map**, it is likely because the source attribute was coded incorrectly for some segments. To fix this:
>
> 1. Click the affected segment on the map to open it in the Coding page.
> 2. Review and correct the attribute value (e.g. change the sub-type for Fixed Obstacle Type).
> 3. Save the segment, then click **Back to Analysis** to return.
> 4. Re-apply the filter — the updated colour will now be reflected on the map.

### 5.4 Export

The page supports three exports:

| Export | Format | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| **Download Table** | CSV | All currently filtered segment rows |
| **Download Images** | ZIP | All images for the currently filtered segments |
| **Download Shapefile** | ZIP (Shapefile) | Filtered segments exported as point geometry with attributes |

**Download Shapefile** exports the currently visible filtered segments as a standard GIS shapefile package (`.zip`). The file is named `shapefile_export_YYYY-MM-DD.zip` and can be opened in QGIS, ArcGIS, or any other GIS application. Only segments that have a valid image reference are included.

### 5.5 Session Continuity

Your selections and filters are kept for the browser session, so navigating away (e.g. to edit a segment in Coding) and returning does not immediately clear the analysis setup.

### 5.6 Finer Filtering Reference

Finer filtering lets you narrow a segment filter down to a specific **sub-type** within a parent category. When an attribute supports it, selecting a top-level value reveals a second dropdown — and the map immediately updates to colour only the segments that match your exact sub-type.

Attributes that support finer filtering are marked **❖** in the filter panel.

#### Which Attributes Support Finer Filtering

| Attribute | Top-level Values | Sub-category Count |
|---|---|---|
| **Facility Width per Direction** ❖ | Very Narrow; Narrow; Wide | 6 width ranges |
| **Curvature** ❖ | Sharp Turn Present; No Sharp Turn Present | 5 radius ranges |
| **Fixed Obstacle on Facility** ❖ | Present; Not Present | 7 obstacle types |
| **Non-Fixed Obstacle on Facility** ❖ | Present; Not Present | 5 obstacle types |
| **Delineation** ❖ | Present; Not Present | 5 delineation types |
| **Crossing Facility** ❖ | Present; Not Present | 5 crossing types |

All other attributes use standard single-level filtering.

#### How to Use Finer Filtering

1. Open Path Analysis and load one or more projects.
2. In the **Filter Segment** panel, select an attribute marked **❖** from the dropdown.
3. Choose a top-level value (e.g. *Present* for Crossing Facility).
4. A **sub-category dropdown** appears immediately below — select the specific sub-type you want (e.g. *Zebra Crossing*).
5. The map updates to colour only segments with that sub-type. Segments with other values are shown in grey.
6. To **change** the sub-category, open the second dropdown and choose a different option.
7. To **clear** finer filtering, click the **×** on the active filter chip, or reset the top-level value to *Not Selected*.

#### Sub-category Reference Table

| Attribute | Trigger Value | Sub-category Options | Map Colour Logic |
|---|---|---|---|
| Facility Width per Direction | Very Narrow | ≤1.5 m · >1.5–1.8 m · >1.8–<2 m | Red → Orange → Amber (narrower = more risk) |
| Facility Width per Direction | Narrow | 2–<3.5 m · 3.5–4 m | Green shades |
| Facility Width per Direction | Wide | >4 m | Blue |
| Curvature | Sharp Turn Present | <6.5 m (footpath threshold) · 6.5–<10 m · Path Junction | Red · Orange · Purple |
| Curvature | No Sharp Turn Present | 10–18 m · >18 m (cycling path threshold ≥18 m) | Green · Blue |
| Fixed Obstacle on Facility | Present | Lamp Post · Traffic Light · Pillar · Bollards · Fence · Vegetation · Others | Unique colour per type |
| Non-Fixed Obstacle on Facility | Present | Barrier · Bins · Bicycle · Cone · Others | Unique colour per type |
| Delineation | Present | Cycling Path · Red Stripe · Signalised Crossing · Traffic Crossing · Zebra Crossing | Unique colour per type |
| Crossing Facility | Present | Zebra Crossing · Signalised PC · Bicycle Crossing · Unsignalised Junction · Development Access | Unique colour per type |

#### Correcting Wrong Sub-category Colours

If the map shows unexpected colours when a sub-category filter is active, this usually means the source attribute was coded with an incorrect or missing sub-type value.

1. Click the affected segment on the map to select it.
2. Click **Open in Coding** (or navigate to the Coding page from the sidebar).
3. In the attribute table, find the relevant attribute (e.g. *Fixed Obstacle Type* for Fixed Obstacle on Facility).
4. Correct the value to the appropriate sub-type from the dropdown.
5. Click **Save** to persist the change and recalculate risk scores.
6. Click **Back to Analysis** in the sidebar to return to Path Analysis.
7. Re-apply the same filter — the corrected colour will now appear on the map.

> This also applies when the CV auto-coder assigns a sub-type incorrectly. The Coding page lets you override any auto-coded value and is the authoritative source for what appears in the filters.
