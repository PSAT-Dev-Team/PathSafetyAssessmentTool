## 1. Getting Started

### 1.1 Using the Help Guide

Click the **Help (?)** button at the top left corner of any page to open the in-app guide. The Help page contains three tabs:

- **User Guide** — step-by-step instructions for all workflows (this guide)
- **Admin Guide** — system deployment, model management, and infrastructure
- **Developer Guide** — technical architecture, API reference, and scoring logic

### 1.2 Open the Project List

Use the **Home** page to browse all projects. You can:

- search by project name or road name
- filter by tags (e.g. NSC, AMK)
- sort by project name, verification progress, distance verified, autocode progress, and last modified time
- select one or more projects for deletion, coding, path analysis, or treatment work

### 1.3 Create a Project

Use **Create Project** when you want to build a new project from the source image folders in `in/`.

You can create a project in three ways:

1. **Single folder** — select one source folder directly
2. **Polygon / Planning Area** — draw a polygon or click a planning area on the map and create a project from multiple selected roads
3. **Upload area GIS layers** — upload area layers to define the project boundary

When creating a project:

- enter a project name without underscores
- add tags if needed (for easy grouping, e.g. NSC, AMK)
- upload images into a source folder if the folder is missing
- check that selected roads are marked as **available** before you create the project

#### Road Highlight on Source Folder Select

When you select a source folder in the Single Folder workflow, PSAT reads the road name from the folder and automatically **highlights the matching road on the map in amber/orange**. The map also pans and zooms to that road so you can visually confirm you are creating the project from the correct location before proceeding.

### 1.4 Navigate Between Workflows

From the project list, you can send selected projects for the following:

| Workflow | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Delete Project** | Housekeeping to remove unwanted projects |
| **Coding** | Detailed attribute review and saving |
| **Analyse Projects** | Multi-project filtering, charts, generate reports and export data, images, shp files |
| **Treatment Application** | Before/after scenario testing |

### 1.5 Viewing and Updating GIS Layers

Click **View GIS Layers** from the sidebar to open the GIS Layers dashboard.

From the GIS Layers page you can:

- Browse all current GIS layers (sorted in alphabetical order)
- View last updated date, required columns, and metadata for each layer
- Using the **Update GIS Layer** button:
  - **Add** entirely new GIS layers for new categories
  - **Replace** an existing layer with an updated file
  - **Delete** a layer that is no longer needed

> For full GIS layer management instructions, see [Section 8: GIS Layer Management](#8-gis-layer-management).
