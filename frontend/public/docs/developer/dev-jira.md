## 10.8 Tips

- **Link related tickets** — inside a ticket, click **Link** to connect it to another issue (e.g. a bug that blocks a task).
- **Attach files** — drag and drop screenshots or log files directly into the ticket description or comment box.
- **Use labels** — add labels like `frontend`, `backend`, `gis`, or `scoring` to make filtering easier.
- **Watch a ticket** — click the eye icon on a ticket to get notified when it is updated.
