# Treatment Configuration

Treatments in PSAT are used to simulate safety improvements on road segments. Each treatment has a set of **triggers** (conditions that must be met for the treatment to be applicable) and **effects** (changes to the road attributes if the treatment is applied).

---

## 6.9 Structure of a Treatment

Treatments are defined as a list of dictionaries in the backend. Each dictionary follows this schema:

```python
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Upgrade to on-road bicycle lane with light segregation",
    "triggers": [
        {"Facility Type": [5], "Light Segregation": [2]},
        {"Facility Type": [6], "Light Segregation": [2]}
    ],
    "effects": {"Facility Type": 4, "Light Segregation": 1, "Facility access": 1}
}
```

### 6.91 Fields Explained

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | Integer | A unique 1-based identifier for the treatment. |
| `name` | String | The display name shown in the Treatment Page. |
| `triggers` | List[Dict] | A list of condition sets. If **any** dictionary in the list matches the segment's attributes, the treatment is applicable (**OR logic** between list items). |
| `effects` | Dict | A dictionary of field-value pairs. When applied, these attributes are updated to the specified values (**1-based indices** from the attribute dropdowns). |

### 6.92 Trigger Logic (AND/OR)

- **OR Logic**: The `triggers` list is a collection of alternative conditions. If a segment satisfies any one of these dictionaries, the treatment becomes a "Recommended Treatment".
- **AND Logic**: Inside a single trigger dictionary, all specified fields must match the segment's current values. For example, `{"Facility Type": [5], "Light Segregation": [2]}` means the segment must be a Road Shoulder (5) **AND** have no Light Segregation (2).

## 6.10 How to Add a New Treatment

To add a new treatment to the system, follow these steps:

1.  **Locate the Definitions**: Open `backend/app/api/projects/routes.py`.
2.  **Find the `TREATMENTS` List**: Search for the `TREATMENTS = [...]` variable near the top of the file.
3.  **Append a New Entry**: Add a new dictionary to the end of the list.
    - Ensure the `id` is the next available integer.
    - Use the correct attribute names as keys (matching the CSV headers).
    - Use the numeric indices for values (e.g., `1` for Present, `2` for Not Present).
4.  **Restart the Backend**: If running in Docker, rebuild or restart the container to pick up the changes.

## 6.11 Implementation Details

The treatment logic is handled by the following endpoints:
- `POST /api/projects/<name>/treatments/preview`: Calculates the score change without saving.
- `POST /api/projects/<name>/treatments/apply`: Persists the treatment to the segment.
- `POST /api/projects/<name>/treatments/effectiveness`: Ranks treatments by how much they reduce risk across the project.

```python
# Internal logic snippet
for trigger_set in treatment["triggers"]:
    if all(row.get(field) in allowed_values for field, allowed_values in trigger_set.items()):
        is_applicable = True
        break
```
