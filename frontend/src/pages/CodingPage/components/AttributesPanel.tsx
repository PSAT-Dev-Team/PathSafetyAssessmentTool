  // Facility configuration
  "Area type": "Classify the surrounding land use. Singapore paths are mostly Suburban (HDB/residential). Use Urban for city area and dense commercial zones, Industrial for business parks and logistics areas, Recreational for parks. Not scored directly but provides environmental context.",
  "Facility Type": "The type of cycling facility at this segment. Off-Road Bicycle Path (dedicated red tarmac) carries the lowest risk; Mixed Traffic Road Lane the highest. Most Singapore cycling facility segments are Multi-Use Path or Off-Road Bicycle Path. Drives VB and BP scores significantly.",
  "Adjacent Sidewalk 0-1m": "Is there a footpath or pedestrian walkway within arm's reach of the cycling path? Common in Singapore where footpath/ covered linkways run immediately beside cycling tracks. Increases BP (cyclist–pedestrian conflict) risk.",
  "Adjacent Sidewalk 1-3m": "Pedestrian footpath further away but still within the risk zone. Contributes to BP score when pedestrians are likely to stray into the cycling lane at lower severity.",
  "Adjacent Road Lane 0-1m": "Is there a motor vehicle lane essentially directly beside the path? Look for road surface, kerb edge, or live traffic in the image. A primary VB trigger. CV auto-codes this for most segments — verify when ambiguous.",
  "Adjacent Road Lane 1-3m": "A motor vehicle lane nearby but separated by a small buffer. Still a VB risk factor. CV auto-codes; confirm when traffic is visible in the mid-ground of the image.",
  "Adjacent Vehicle Parking 0-1m": "Is there a car park bay or on-street parking directly beside the path? Door-opening hazard and sight-line obstruction. Common along HDB estate perimeter roads and neighbourhood carparks.",
  "Adjacent Vehicle Parking 1-3m": "Parked vehicles slightly further out from the cycling facility. Still contributes to SB departure risk at lower severity.",
  "Adjacent object or level change 0-1m": "A non-vehicle edge hazard <= 60cm high immediately beside the path without safety barrier: concrete drain, kerb drop, retaining wall, or steep embankment. CV mirrors the Adjacent Road Lane 0–1m result. Affects SB score.",
  "Adjacent object or level change 1-3m": "Same class of edge hazard at 1–3m distance. Contributes to SB departure risk at lower severity.",

  // Facility clear width
  "Facility access": "Can cyclists enter and exit this segment without obstruction? Code Inadequate if there are bollard gates, anti-cyclist/motorcycle chicanes, narrow entry posts, non barrier free access or raised kerb lips at the segment boundary.",
  "Light Segregation": "Is there a physical separator between the cycling path and motor vehicle traffic? Covers kerbs, railings, and flexible post delineators. Default is Present when a path is detected. A protective factor — reduces VB risk when present.",
  "Fixed Obstacle on Facility": "A permanent physical object on the cycling path: lamp post, utility pillar, bollard, fence, or large vegetation. Check the image carefully for anything cyclists must steer around. Use FO Type sub-field to record the type of fixed obstacle.",
  "Non-Fixed Obstacle on Facility": "A movable or temporary object blocking or narrowing the path: litter bin, traffic cone, construction barrier, or parked bicycle/motorcycle. Use NFO Type sub-field to choose the type of non fixed obstacle.",
  "Facility Width per Direction": "Usable cycling width in the direction of travel. Very Narrow paths carry the highest risk multiplier; Wide paths are neutral. GIS auto-codes from path width data based on Dec 2024 LIDAR survey. Use the Facility Width Sub-category to record the approximate width range.",
  "Width Restriction": "Is there a local pinch point mid-segment that narrows the path below its general width by at least 20% — e.g. a signpost, tree stump, or irregular bollard arrangement? Adds risk even when the overall width is adequate.",
  "Adjacent Severe Hazard 0-1m": "A high-consequence hazard immediately beside the path that would cause serious injury if struck: deep open drain, bridge parapet gap, or unguarded steep drop. Increases SB severity substantially. Common at elevated cycling facility sections and waterway paths.",
  "Adjacent Severe Hazard 1-3m": "Same class of severe hazard at 1–3m distance. Still a significant SB severity factor but at lower severity.",
  "Line of Sight": "Whether cyclists have clear forward visibility at curves or obstructions. Code if clearly observable; otherwise leave as-is.",

  // Facility surface conditions
  "Delineation": "Is there visible marking separating cycling space from pedestrian space or centreline separating the directions of cyclist travel? In Singapore: red tarmac, red-and-white painted lines, shared-path arrows, or \"Cyclists\" / \"Pedestrians\" signage. CV model auto-codes this — verify when markings are faded or absent.",
  "Major Surface Deformation or Drain Opening": "Is there a significant structural surface defect: deep pothole, cracked and raised joint, exposed drain grating with a wheel-trapping gap, or severely buckled surface?",
  "Loose or slippery surface": "Is there loose material, wet algae, fallen leaves, sand, or a slippery coating that makes the surface slippery? Use the Issue Type sub-field to specify the material.",
  "Grade": "Is this segment on a slope steep enough to affect cycling control? Most Singapore paths are flat — flag ramp sections, hillside paths. Check the gradient profile in the GIS context panel if available.",
  "Curvature": "Does this segment include a tight bend that forces sudden steering or cuts forward visibility? Use the Curvature Sub-category to record the approximate bend radius or path intersection.",
  "Tram or Train Rails": "Are there rail tracks crossing or embedded in the cycling path at a shallow angle? Rail grooves are a well-known bicycle-wheel trap. Rare in Singapore, check near LRT or KTM level crossings.",
  "Street Lighting": "Is the segment illuminated at night by street lamps or dedicated path lighting? Most Singapore urban and suburban paths have lighting. Default is Present.",

  // Intersection
  "Intersection Approach": "How is the cycling approach to a road crossing arranged? Shared means the cyclist merges with or crosses through motor vehicle flow without a dedicated cycling route. Separate/NA means a clearly marked dedicated cyclist approach exists, or there is no crossing at this segment. Most signalised Singapore crossings with a bicycle waiting box qualify as Separate.",
  "Intersection or Road Crossing": "Is there a road junction or formal road crossing within this segment. GIS auto-codes from the road crossing layer.",
  "Crossing Facility": "Is there a formal aid to help cyclists cross the road: zebra crossing, signalised pedestrian crossing, or a cycle-specific signal phase? Not Present raises VB risk. Use the Crossing Type sub-field to specify what is present.",
  "Property Access": "Does a driveway, carpark entrance, or building service access cut across the cycling path within this segment? Reversing or turning vehicles create unpredictable conflicts. Very common at HDB multi-storey carparks, shopping centres, schools and industrial units.",
  "Pedestrian Crossing": "Is there a potential pedestrian crossing across this segment that cyclists must also navigate through? Often co-located with MRT exits, bus stops, activity generating nodes, and near to formal crossings.",
  "Intersecting Bicycle Facility": "Does another cycling path or PCN route cross or join the current segment? Look for bicycle route merge points and junctions visible on the map.",
  "Number of lanes – adjacent road": "How many lanes in each direction does the road running beside this segment have? Multi-lane roads increase VB risk. GIS auto-codes from the kerb layer; manually verify for complex or split-road arrangements.",
  "Number of lanes – intersecting road": "How many lanes does the road being crossed at this segment's intersection have? More lanes mean a longer, more exposed crossing. Increases VB risk. At development accesses and crossings.",

  // Flow & Speed
  "Flow Direction": "Is cycling occurring or permitted in both directions on this path? Two-way flow introduces head-on conflict risk. Most Singapore off road cycling facility are bi-directional by convention even where no physical barrier exists. Check for directional arrow markings on cycling facilities.",
  "Peak pedestrian flow along or across facility": "How busy is this path or crossing with pedestrians at peak hours? GIS auto-codes from sensor and count data where available. Higher pedestrian activity directly increases BP (cyclist–pedestrian) risk.",
  "Peak bicycle/LV traffic flow": "How busy is the cycling path at peak hour? GIS auto-codes from count sensors. Consider paths near MRT stations, schools, or cycling rental hubs.",
  "Observed proportion of cargo bikes and mopeds": "What proportion of cyclists use cargo bikes, delivery e-bikes, or large LPMs? Low is the default. Moderate-to-high increases BB (cyclist–cyclist) severity. Consider proximity to delivery hubs, industrial clusters, or food court corridors.",
  "Heavy vehicle flow": "How much heavy vehicle traffic (lorries, buses, prime movers) uses the adjacent road? Moderate-to-high increases VB risk. GIS auto-codes using bus lane proximity as a proxy.",
  "Bicycle/LV speed – average": "Estimated average cycling speed on this segment. Higher speed increases severity for fall, speed-related, and vehicle-conflict scenarios. Most Singapore shared paths are designed for lower speeds; flag where e-bikes are common or where path geometry encourages faster riding.",
  "Bicycle/LV speed differential": "How much does cycling speed vary between faster and slower users on this path? High differential (e.g. speed e-bikes overtaking pedestrian-pace cyclists) increases BB severity. Common on wide shared paths near rental bike stations.",
  "Road AADT": "Annual Average Daily Traffic: total vehicles using the adjacent road per day. Obtained from LTA ERP2 data. Higher AADT increases VB score via a stepped lookup.",
  "Road operating speed (mean)": "Observed average vehicle speed on the adjacent road. GIS auto-codes from the ERP2 LinkID layer. Higher speed increases multiplier for vehicle-bicycle conflict severity.",
  "Road operating speed (unit)": "Select the unit for Road Operating Speed (mean). Singapore roads use km/h.",
  "Road speed limit": "The posted legal speed limit of the adjacent road. GIS auto-codes from the speed limit layer. Displayed for context only, does not feed directly into CycleRAP scoring formulas.",
